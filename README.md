# GlobalPrescription


This app gives the user access to Federal Drug Administration database that houses a list of drugs. Then the app finds the drug international equivalencies based on a active ingredient. This database could also serve as a patient database for hospitals in the third world countries who still keep track of patient information using pen and paper.
